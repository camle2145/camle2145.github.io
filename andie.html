            <p>ANDIE is a non-destructive image editor, written in Java.</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>ANDIE was a university group project, meant to improve collaboration and development skills. It was a
                great introduction to Git and the dynamic of developing software in a team.
            </p>
            <p>The project had two deadlines with a variety of requirements. A few features that I worked on were
                Gaussian Blur, area transparency, and CI/CD.
            </p>
            <p>Gaussian Blur was the first feature I worked on, and it took a while. Familiarising myself with ANDIE's
                skeleton codebase took some learning, and Gaussian Blur had some relatively tricky maths that introduced
                some complications.
            </p>
            <p>I developed area transparency as an extra feature, and I really enjoyed implenting it, using
                breadth-first search (BFS) to make similar colours transparent. It felt like a feature that a real image
                editor would have, and it was satisfying utilisng BFS, which I had learnt in another class.
            </p>
            <p>CI/CD was straightforward to implement for ANDIE, with a few simple tests, packaging the project into a
                zip, and uploading it to a website for download. It wasn't a topic that I had explored extensively
                before, so it was really interesting exploring DevOps after spending most of the project writing code.
            </p>
