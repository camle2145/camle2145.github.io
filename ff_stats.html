            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>Firstly, I needed data for my database. Originally I used some CSV files available on GitHub to put into
                my database, but the information was outdated and not relevant at all to what I wanted to achieve. Later
                on, I used an external API to get data in JSON format, and used scripts to remove irrelvant information
                (such as defensive players, which aren't relevant in fantasy football), and to convert it into CSV
                files.
            </p>

            <p>From there, I created a PostgresQL database using the CSV files. It took a few goes to ensure that
                columns were matching up and that keys were working, and some adjustments were required later on.
            </p>
            <p>I used the Spring Boot framework to build my Java back-end, and although tutorials and guides helped, a
                lot of the learning I did was just through trial and error and running into issues as I went.
            </p>
            <p>The front-end wasn't supposed to be anything fancy, so I made a simple front-end with the help of AI, as
                the front-end was simply a vehicle to display the learning I did on the back-end.
            </p>
