            <h2> Fantasy Football Stats</h2>
            <p>Fantasy Football Stats is a full-stack application for accessing NFL fantasy information.

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>Firstly, I needed data for my database. Originally I used some CSV files available on GitHub to put into
                my database, but the information was outdated and not relevant at all to what I wanted to achieve. Later
                on, I used an external API to get data in JSON format, and used scripts to remove irrelvant information
                (such as defensive players, which aren't relevant in fantasy football), and to convert it into CSV
                files.
            </p>

            <p>From there, I created a PostgresQL database using the CSV files. It took a few goes to ensure that
                columns were matching up and that keys were working, and some adjustments were required later on.
            </p>
            <p>I used the Spring Boot framework to build my Java back-end, and although tutorials and guides helped, a
                lot of the learning I did was just through trial and error and running into issues as I went.
            </p>
            <p>The front-end wasn't supposed to be anything fancy, so I made a simple front-end with the help of AI, as
                the front-end was simply a vehicle to display the learning I did on the back-end.
            </p>

            <h2>ANDIE</h2>
            <p>ANDIE is a non-destructive image editor, written in Java.</p>

            <img alt="Demo" src="andie_demo.gif" />
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>ANDIE was a university group project, meant to improve collaboration and development skills. It was a
                great introduction to Git and the dynamic of developing software in a team.
            </p>
            <p>The project had two deadlines with a variety of requirements. A few features that I worked on were
                Gaussian Blur, area transparency, and CI/CD.
            </p>
            <p>Gaussian Blur was the first feature I worked on, and it took a while. Familiarising myself with ANDIE's
                skeleton codebase took some learning, and Gaussian Blur had some relatively tricky maths that introduced
                some complications.
            </p>
            <p>I developed area transparency as an extra feature, and I really enjoyed implenting it, using
                breadth-first search (BFS) to make similar colours transparent. It felt like a feature that a real image
                editor would have, and it was satisfying utilisng BFS, which I had learnt in another class.
            </p>
            <p>CI/CD was straightforward to implement for ANDIE, with a few simple tests, packaging the project into a
                zip, and uploading it to a website for download. It wasn't a topic that I had explored extensively
                before, so it was really interesting exploring DevOps after spending most of the project writing code.
            </p>
